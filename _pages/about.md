My name is Nguyen Vuong (Vương Lê Minh Nguyên). I am a data science enthusiast with a passion for building data-driven solutions to business problems at scale. I am currently working as a Risk Management Data Scientist at [ZaloPay](https://zalopay.vn/), a digital wallet company in Vietnam. My current focuses are mostly on generic solutions to financial frauds such as fake/clone account detection and device intelligence. Beside that, I also have practical experience on route optimization, geo-spatial data analysis, Vietnamese NLP, and ML Ops.

I am interested in a wide range of topics in computer science and data science. I am also a big fan of the open source community. Hopefully one day in the near future, I will be able to contribute to open source projects.

I am always open to freelance remote opportunities, so feel free to contact me at [freelance.contact@nguyenvlm.com](mailto:freelance.contact@nguyenvlm.com) if you are looking for a data scientist or machine learning engineer for your project.
